## E-commerce Database Design
# Project Overview
This project involves designing a database schema for an e-commerce platform. The goal is to create an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and implement corresponding database tables to manage product details, variations, categories, and user interactions.

# Project Structure
- Entities: Key tables include product_image, color, product_category, product, product_item, brand, product_variation, size_category, size_option, product_attribute, attribute_category, and attribute_type.

- Relationships: Defined relationships ensure proper data linking, such as products having variations and categories.

- Keys: Each table has a primary key, and foreign keys ensure data integrity.

# Data Flow
The database handles data interactions such as product retrieval, inventory management, and order processing. Data flows between entities based on user actions like selecting products and variations.

# Collaboration
- GitHub: We used GitHub for version control and collaboration, ensuring all team members contributed to the design and implementation.

- Database Implementation: The ecommerce.sql file contains SQL code to create the tables and relationships.
